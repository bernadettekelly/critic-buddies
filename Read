App Name: Critic Buddies

Summary: This app allows users to post movie reviews for their friends to read, as well as read the reviews their friends write. When users log in, they are able to see their past reviews and are able to edit and delete them if they wish. To view their friends views, they can search on the homepage. 
For new users, they can easily create an account by creating a username and password.
The idea behind the app is to create a platform that allows users to learn their friends' opinions, which they may find more useful than those of strangers.

Documentation of API: This app has six URL enpoints used to access data.
URL - stores all movie reviews by every user.
USER-MR-URL - stores movie reviews for a particular user.
LOGOUT_URL - used to end a user's session.
LOGIN_URL - used for a user to lgin and begin a new session.
ID_URL - stores reviews posts by ID.
USERS_URL - stores user data once a new user is created.

Technology used: For this app, Node.js was used to write the API, while Express was used as the web framework. NPM was used as the package manager, and MongoDB for the database manager. For testing, I used the Mocha framework with the chai library and Mongoose schemas to express expected value types.
For my frontend code, I used HTML to create the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to make the app functional for the user.
